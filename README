Requirements: 

- Operating Systems: GNU Linux, OSX
- Ruby tmail (not sendmail)
- rubygems: sequel (very fast db adapter)
- Email Scheme: .maildir style (tested with postfix)
- Required Unix tools: gnu find, grep, cat, cut, head, tail, file, sed 
    (all part of default GNU LINUX systems)
- Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.8.7
- Recommended ruby version: Ruby-1.8.7 (much faster and  less memory)
- rsync  (included in osx and many Linux distros)


Performance:

- Run Time: a bit slow: 5-10 seconds to parse 100 emails on opteron CPU.
- Memory usage: (parsing 100 emails, ruby-1.8.7, OSX 10.5.6)
    - Residual Memory: 15MB 
    - Virtual Memory: 29MB


Todos:

- Write tests
- Test on ruby-1.9
- Check the timezone different between developers and server....
- Improve memory usage 
- rewrite parse methods to use ruby methods instead of unix tools 
  will be slower, but more portable to other Operating systems



Recomendations:

- Configure your application to use TMAIL to send your emails,
  because tmail will set message_id in the email before hand,  
  so that you will be able to save it in the database.
  Set ActionMailer.delivery_method => :smtp 
  instead of ActionMailer.delivery_method => :sendmail, 
  because sendmail (postfix) will not set the message_id, 
  thus you will not be able to see the real message_id.
